Hello, I'm Julia Lin. I'm a third year CS student. 

My preliminary ideas for the project:
   - Profiles for individual users within the UCSB domain
   - Peer to peer messaging interface
   - Regular discussion prompts to inspire engagement
   - Some measure of "progress", so maybe user badges or achievements...

Overall, a web-based platform that allows for peer connection and mutual language practice.
