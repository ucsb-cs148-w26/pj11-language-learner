**Problem Scenario**

Students are at various stages of independent language learning and lack meaningful ways to practice real conversation. Students studying a given language are unaware of the landscape of peers studying the same. Existing formal education or self-learning resources do not prioritize matchmaking peers with similar proficiency and ambition. There is a need for a platform that connects same-level language learners and enriches language learning through informal, peer-to-peer conversation. 


Prospective UCSB student #1 is someone who is learning a language that wants to practice speaking with another learner.  
Prospective UCSB student #2 learning the same language also wants to practice speaking with another learner.  
#1 and #2 expect to be connected with another student from UCSB (such as each other) through the product.
