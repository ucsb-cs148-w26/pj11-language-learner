# Date of Retrospective: 01/23/2026

* Led by: Kun Cheng
* Present: Jovia Low, Julia Lin, Annie Yang, Natalie Forte, Benny Zhang, Ryan Choi, Kun Cheng,
* Absent: Abhiram Agina (Excused)

## Action item
* a goal: Every time when someone makes a PR make sure the Hash tag, issue, etc are included and assign themselves to it. Include how it should be reviewed. 
* a change/experiment: Starting next week, every code change must be tracked end-to-end via GitHub:
  * Before coding: create/claim an Issue on the Kanban board (assign yourself).
  * When opening a PR: include the linked issue (e.g., `#issue-id`), relevant labels/tags, and a short **“How to review”** section (what to test, what to look at).
  * Keep the board accurate: move the card **To Do → In Progress → In Review → Done** within 24 hours of a status change.
* a measurement: We’ll check the following next retro:
  * Traceability rate: % of PRs that correctly link to an Issue (target: **100%**).
  * Stale work rate: number of Issues/PRs with no update or board movement for **>48 hours** (target: **0–1 max**).

## Optional
* None.

## Retro Assessment

* **Process used:** Start / Stop / Continue round-robin; then grouped items into a single concrete experiment for next week.
* **How it went:** Good alignment—multiple people independently raised “communicate earlier” and “make PR expectations clearer.” We also landed on a specific workflow change rather than only general advice.
* **Advice for next retro leader:**
  * Timebox each section (e.g., 2–3 minutes per person).
  * Convert discussion into **one** specific change with clear “definition of done.”
  * End by assigning an owner to gather the measurements (PR links, stale issues, cycle time) before the next retro.


## Experiment/Change

* **What constitutes the change/experiment:** For the next week, work should be visible and traceable:
  * Each task has an Issue on the Kanban board with an assignee.
  * Each PR links to its Issue (`#issue-id`), includes tags/labels, and has a short “How to review” section.
  * Kanban status is updated within 24 hours when work moves stages.
* **Assessment of results:** (Fill in next retro)
  * Traceability rate: ___%
  * Stale work rate (>48h no update): ___
  * Median cycle time (In Progress → Done): ___
  * Last-minute PRs (last 24h): ___%
  * Notes: ______________________________________
* **Decision going forward:** (Fill in next retro)
  * ☐ Keep the change
  * ☐ Revert to previous procedure
  * ☐ Modify the procedure / new experiment: ______________________
