My name is Natalie Forte. 
I'm a second year CS major. 

I imagine that we will roughly create:
(1) A sign-up functionality where users enter their university, language, name, and profile picture.
(2) An explore page to find people to chat with. 
(3) A messaging system where people can chat. 

Later on, it would be nice to add more language learning-oriented features.
