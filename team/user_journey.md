# User Journey

## Beginning
A UCSB student wants to improve a language, but practicing alone feels unmotivating and there is no consistent, low-pressure environment to have conversational practice with people at the same learning level.

## Middle
1. The student joins the platform and shares their language learning goals and interests.
2. The student finds other learners who are compatible, with similar goals, interests, or experience level.
3. The student connects with one or more peers and begins practice through conversation.
4. The student continues to interact over time, building confidence and consistency.

## End
The student gets regular practice with real people, feels motivated to continue learning, and improves language skills and confidence through conversation.
