# NF - Hello World App

This webpage is deployed to the cloud with Vercel.

**URL: https://nf-hello-world.vercel.app/**

---

I used React:
```
npx create-react-app nf-hello-world
```
Note that create-react-app is deprecated, but it works for this simple assignment.

To run locally at http://localhost:3000/, use:
```
npm start
```
