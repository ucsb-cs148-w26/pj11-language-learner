## Framework

**Technologies:** React, next.js, Vercel.

**Reason:** We chose React since it allows us to create a modern, component-based UI development. Next.js is        full-stack capatible and most of our teammate are familar with it. By using Vercel, we are able to deploy       instantly and review the features in the URLS in time.
