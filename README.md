## Framework

**Technologies:** React, next.js, Vercel.

**Reason:** We chose React since it allows us to create a modern, component-based UI development. Next.js is        full-stack capatible and most of our teammate are familar with it. By using Vercel, we are able to deploy       instantly and review the features in the URLS in time.

## Plan

We will build a messaging-based language learning web app where users create profiles (native/target language and interests), find compatible peers, and chat to practice together. Our MVP focuses on profile + matching + messaging, and we’ll add light game-like features to support long-term motivation.

## Audience

Our users will be college students (UCSB) looking to learn languages through chatting with a native speaker who is also a college student (UCSB). This will be the bulk of our userbase, and some secondary roles can be moderators who could delete unruly profiles.
